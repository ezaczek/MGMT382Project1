<p style = "text-align: center; font-size: 15px">I have never been to a writing warehouse before, and I was skepticle at the type of service I would recieve at first. Not only was I pleasantly surprised by how much the employees cared about me and my experience, but my expectations were far exceeded. From walking into the door and being greated by a smiling face, to having every question be answered, to getting the product that best fit my needs I give my experience at Willie and Willy's Writing Warehouse a 10/10</p>
