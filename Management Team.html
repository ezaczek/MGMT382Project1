Ellie started Willie and Willy's Writing Warehouse in 2012 after working with two young writers, Willie and Willy. She was so inspired by their talent that she wanted to continue helping more amateur and professional writers develop their careers, and named the company in honor of the two young men that started it all: Willie and Willy.

From here, Gregory has learned what new types of services are needed in the market now, and can create aesthetically pleasing products that writers will want to use.
