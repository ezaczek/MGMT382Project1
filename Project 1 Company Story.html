<font size = "4"> Our dedicated team formed Willie and Willy's about 5 weeks ago on a cold winter day in West Lafayette. This team of <a href= "https://purdue.edu" target = "_blank">Purdue University</a>
 students put their talents together to make the world of writing a better place. Some might say that 5 weeks is a short amount of time, but we've taken the writing world by storm.
 We started our revolutionary journey by just selling writing supplies, and in our first week, we had sold out of our <i>entire inventory</i>. Going into our second week, we expanded our operations. 
 We secured a wholesale supplier and warehouse space, and we more than doubled the amount of products we were able to move. With so many writers coming to us for equipment, we decided to ask them how we could better help them, and they wanted help with their writing.
 In our third week, we released our trademark writing support services. The writers loved it! For the past two weeks we've been meeting with writers around the clock helping improve their writer and prepare for those future publisher meetings.
